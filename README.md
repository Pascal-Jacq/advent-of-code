# advent-of-code
My setup to quickly hack my way through the daily advent of code problem

# Install 
If you are using Visual Studio Code : Install the dev container extension, then run "Rebuild and Reopen in container"

If you are using python : pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
To generate and open a notebook ready to today's puzzle

From inside the dev container just type : "go" or : "go {day} {year}" 

From a terminal type : "python advent.py" or "python advent.py {day} {year}"
Then open the generated notebook using your jupyter notebook/lab/hub
